This individual assignment involved programming a finite state machine on an STM32 NUCLEO-F401RE microcontroller equipped with an application shield. The project implemented a world clock capable of displaying multiple global time zones, alongside integrated timer and countdown functionalities operating simultaneously. The system was designed to manage these modes through efficient state transitions, ensuring responsive user interactions and precise timing control within the embedded hardware constraints.

The software was developed using Keil Studio Cloud, enabling browser-based coding, compilation, and debugging directly on the connected hardware. Functional validation and performance testing were carried out on the physical NUCLEO-F401RE board to confirm accurate timing, reliable mode switching, and smooth operation of concurrent tasks.
