# CPDPortfolio


I'm Vincent Vanhegan. From Nottingham, I hold a First-Class BEng in Mechatronic Engineering from Manchester. I work at the intersection of hardware and software, stay active with Kabaddi, Volleyball, HEMA, and Rock Climbing, and contribute to the community through nature-based volunteering and beekeeping.
