# Embedded Systems Project <br>

As a team of five, we designed and built an autonomous line-following robot from the ground up. Our work included creating a custom line-sensing PCB, implementing a PID control algorithm to ensure smooth and accurate line tracking, and developing a compact chassis design that optimised hardware placement while maintaining stable, safe turning.
