This individual project explored combining soft and rigid robotics to develop a vine robot with a configurable body. The concept focused on integrating multiple internal revolute joints to enable adaptable movement and shape control. The mechanical design was modelled using SolidWorks, while MATLAB and Simulink were used to simulate the system dynamics and evaluate actuation behaviour. A custom user interface was implemented in MATLAB App Designer (As shown above) to visualize control inputs and real-time configuration changes.
